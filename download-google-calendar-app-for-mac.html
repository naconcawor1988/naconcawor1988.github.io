Apple’s built-in calendar app, iCal, is a go-to for scheduling - you can invite other attendees to events, link to maps, set notifications, and add events using natural language (if you type, “meeting with Joe at 2 pm Friday” and iCal will auto-create the calendarized entry).<br><a href='/realtek-bluetooth-driver-windows-7.html' title='Realtek'>Realtek</a> bluetooth driver windows 7. However, greater functionality is required for scheduling many projects and events. Perhaps you need to access calendar information on multiple devices that aren’t all Apple products. Maybe you want to keep an editable to-do list inside your calendar app. There’s also the possibility that you just want an alternative to what comes standard on a Mac. Below you’ll find a roundup of the top calendar apps for Mac, as well as iCal add-ons so you can manage your schedule your way.</p><h2 id='download-google-calendar-app-for-mac-os'>Download Google Calendar App For Mac Os</h2><h3>Top 5 Calendar Apps for Mac That Will Keep You Organized</h3><p>Looking for a Mac calendar app that goes beyond the features offered by iCal? These five apps, that work with Mac OS X or later, have all the essential calendar features plus added functionality including the ability to add tasks, to-do lists, weather updates, and customization options that will give you just the experience you want.<br>1.

You can even program calendar sets to appear by location, so that when you’re home, you only see the calendars related to your personal life.<br>Other helpful features of Fantastical 2 include the widget and Mini Window. The widget supports extensions so you can add other important daily information, like weather, to your daily calendar. The Mini Window lives in your menu bar and is easily editable for quick updates - a helpful tool for those viewing their calendar on desktop. </p><p>The latest version of Fantastical 2.2 is available for $49.99.

The auto-schedule feature allows you to place tasks into a timeline so you can easily view deadlines and identify how many tasks you can complete in a day or week. Use SmartDay as an organizational tool by attaching notes and documents to events, and even include checklists within your notes. For example, you can add a grocery list to a scheduled shopping event. <br>The calendar app runs on a Mac, but iOS and other device versions are available, as well as a web-based option.
