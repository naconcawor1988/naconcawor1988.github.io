I reveal here theexperience I got via experimentation which lead me to the point to be able toreproduce almost everything in this domain. Definitely and old model kit freakfor static aircraft models since 40 years I was forced to discover this hobby accidentally, when cheated by people to whom I ordered and paid special decals for my kits.Of course my previous experience with 2D aircraft profile making was anadvantage as I was familiar with design software. Then I explored the blankdecal paper domain where I learned again the hard way. Last but not least Ilearned to produce faithful color prints with laser printers. Well if you manageall that then be sure you have done 98% of your way to .perfection</font></p><p><font face='Arial' size='3' color='#0000FF'><b> THE REASONS WHY</b></font></p><p><font face='Arial'>Now why one should ever bother do that ? Well , I havediscovered 7 main reasons for it , which are the following ones :</font></p><ol><li><font face='Arial'><b>You can not find</b> those very personalized ones you want to do . A model is something of your own choice , part of your own motivation and you mean to do this<b> particular model</b> you have into your mind with those <b>particular decals</b></font></li><li><font face='Arial'>You may find similar ones but <b> you cannot get them at the scale of the model you make</b></font></li><li><font face='Arial'>They are at times <b>lousy and old </b>with some rare vintage kits and worth only throwing them away. </font></li><li><font face='Arial'>They are <b>often expensive</b> - at times very expensive - and if one is destroyed you have to <b>buy them again </b></font></li><li><font face='Arial'>You can <b>reproduce </b>them<b> as many times as you like </b>or correct them re-edit and reprint them </font></li><li><font face='Arial'><b>You may be cheated , </b>as I had <b>, if sold to you by someone else . </b>Once I ordered them , I paid for them and the guy simply forgot me for ever. Another one produced them on a wrong paper type and never cared to replace them . Overall I have lost in this business something like more than 300 dollars and when at wits end .I decided to learn how to do it myself </font></li><li><font face='Arial'>Although rare , however it happened to me twice : <b>decals bought</b> by a famous model shop where <b>wrong for the scale</b> and became useless for my model</font></li></ol><p><font face='Arial' size='3' color='#0000FF'><b>THE PRINTER</b></font></p><p><font face='Arial'>You should <b>only use a LASER PRINTER</b> basedon 4-color toners of YMCB or <b><font color='#0000FF'>Yellow, Magenta , Cyan andBlack</font>.</b> Although some peopleadvertise ways to produce ink jet decals I found out that these are simplyimpossible to survive water even if covered by special liquids that aresupposedly made to protect them. That , expensive stuff , never worked with me .On the contrary I never had to do anything additional to those printed withLaser Printers. The color there burns deeply the thin film layer of the decalpaper and penetrates into its pores so that it finally stays unharmed even ifleft for too much time in the water - I tried one for about 1 day with absolutesuccess !! </font></p><p><font face='Arial'>Before you tell me that a laser printer is expensive , Isay this : <b>Do you have a friend who has one</b> and will let you use it? If so , don't bother for the money. </font></p><img src='https://images.downloadcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HP-LightScribe-Simple-Labeler.jpg' alt='Decal' title='Decal'><p><font face='Arial'>If you have to buy one then now there is a solution and itis called <font color='#FF0000'><b>SAMSUNG CLP-315</b></font> , available inmost countries at a price ranging from 120 to 190 euros ( <b>I bought it for 150</b>) it is the smallest , cheapest and effective for the job . </font></p><p align='center'><font face='Arial'><b>SAMSUNG CLP-315</b></font></p><p><font face='Arial'>Despite some hard - at times horrible - comments in someweb pages by 'experts' , I tried it with a friend who has bought one forhis normal color printing. I discovered that all comments were biased and mostof them untrue to the bone ! After having done some experimentation I rushed tobuy one and I'm pleased for my choice . As with all laser printers the ink isthe most expensive part , but .wait a minute ! Which is the printer that doesnot cost as much or even less than the ink you pay to replace ? The four tonersof the SAMSUNG CLP-315 cost me around 140-160 euros but even a normal inkjet printer on the market that is sold around 60-70 euros needs cartridges thatcost around 40 euros . Luckily the SAMSUNG CLP-315 is priced far below the 600+euro range </font></p><p align='center'><font face='Arial'><b><font color='#FF0000'>SAMSUNG CLP-315 </font><font color='#0000FF'>openedto see the emplacement of the 4-color cartridges</font></b></font></p><p><font face='Arial'>You know , with your personal decals you are more thandemanding . The only limitation is that with laser printers ,of all kinds , somelight colors are printed at a bit lower strength. Even with commercial decalsthe case is similar and at times even worse. This you may either accept as is or, why not , correct accordingly with your software after some trials . Thedesign software has easy ways of changing any colors to any strength thusovercoming the printer quality shortcomings</font></p><p><font face='Arial' size='3' color='#0000FF'><b> THE PAPER</b></font></p><p><font face='Arial'>Hmmm. Believe it or not the blank paper on which you haveto print your decals is rather rare on the market. I have found so far only 2sources for it, one in UK from a special modelers shop and the other in US. Forsome reason the first one sells limited quantities and at a double price thanthe US guy. The US guy sells plenty of them on-line and half the price incomparison !

The same goes for aircraft say of the US navy painted white or very lightgray. </font></p><table border='0' width='1080' height='35'><tbody><tr><td width='529' height='35'><font face='Arial'>See the picture of the model to the left to get the idea. This AEGEAN Regional Jet in 1/144 scale (Revell) is all painted white above and light gray below. All the decals where printed on </font><font face='arial,helvetica'><strong>Clear Decal Paper </strong>and as you see they all contrast with the model's background. In areas where few white is necessary it is printed transparently by the printer on the decal but due to the white below that is complementing the loss of the white from the printer , there is nothing wrong at the end with the entire impression made. </font></td></tr></tbody></table><p><font face='Arial'>If however you want to produce , say white letters on adark blue model background you should remember that the white you put from yoursoftware to be printed will never appear ! Transparent will only be seenwhere you have put white to be printed. </font></p><p><font face='Arial'>You may of course try to paint previously on the model awhite area where the white is expected to appear while the rest of the decals isprinted around in the model's say dark blue as if you produce a masking effect.This can work albeit not in all cases and the need is of course to matchsuccessfully the decal all around color with the exact one on the model . Itried it successfully 2-3 times but you may do almost the same and even betterby using the </font><font face='arial,helvetica'><strong>White Decal Paper. </strong>Here, <b>the background film</b> where the decals will be printed <b>is white</b>and will print white where you designed so with the software. This white howeverwill stay there for the surrounding of the white numbers too unless you mask itaround with the exact model color. This <b>' <u><i>exact '</i></u></b>color can be achieved with the software of course but in the worst of cases youmay use with a tiny brush the very same model paint after applying the decal .This work is not very difficult and works pretty well sometimes - you shouldonly remain cautious with your brush. </font></p><table border='0' width='1037' height='1'><tbody><tr><td width='525' height='35'><font face='Arial'>See the picture of the model to the left to get the idea. This F4F Wildcat model in 1/48 (HobbyBoss) depicts the personal plane of Cpt John Thatch at the Battle of Midway with 3 kills , Felix the Cat ( his personal emblem ) and the white numbers 23 on the fuselage , large in middle and small aft . By the way until that time I had not yet applied the US star insignia, that's why they are missing for now. </font><p><font face='Arial'>Since white can never come from the printer I had to use <b>White Decal Paper</b> for the white to appear. At the same time however I had to 'mask' the rest around the white of the decals with a color that was equal to the 'middle blue' of the model. You'll see later that whatever the color , you can match it with the software so never mind that I have used a non-standard mixture to achieve this middle US navy middle blue. </font></p><p><font face='Arial'>Watch below the printed decal how it looks like before I put it on the model </font></p></td></tr><tr><td width='547' height='35'><font face='Arial'>I create a colored area of masking around each decal which I can later cut-down to what is a necessary minimum before applying. Preferably I cut as close as possible to the decal's periphery . I then correct if necessary with some model paint around it . </font><p><font face='Arial'>On the contrary the black No 23 on the wings and the black strip walk-on strip were made on <b>Clear Decal paper</b> because as their color is black there is no need for any white color to appear , although , even so I could have used the same technique as the black is a color that is printed by the printer . In that case of course the white decal background is useless but even if used can still serve for the production of this particular decal </font></p></td></tr><tr><td width='547' height='35'><p><font face='Arial'>To the right you see another one of my projects. This is a F9F-Panther jet scale 1/72. The model was taken from an old cheap Matchbox kit for the Blue Angels. I wanted however to create the plane depicted in the film 'The Bridges at Toko-Ri' , starring Wil. Holden as Lt Brew baker with this 209 , B group , VMF 192 plane. The model exists with Monogram in 1/.48 but there are no decals in the world for this scale. So I made them , all with White background and masked around with the dark sea blue equal to the the Revel paint SM350 enamel which I used for the model .</font></p></td></tr><tr><td width='525' height='1'><font face='Arial'>A similar job was done to honor my friend <b>Col. Steve Sprios Pisanos the American Eagles and USAF</b><b>ace</b> and at the same time my modelist friend Bill Bell from New Jersey. We both bought a <b>P-47C</b> from an old Revell kit in 1/32 and wanted to reproduce faithfully the <b>'Miss Plainfiled' </b>Spiros was flying with. The decals are sold with Hannants for the 1/48 scale , except that <u>they are wrong </u>(!) as Spiros himself told us and provided us with the correct ones. These decals were of course very large so I dedicated one whole file for them and I printed it 3 times , the second one for Bill and the third for a friend of his who admires Spiros too . By the way I do not do a commercial business here , it is just between friends that I only do it and for free </font><p><font face='Arial'>These decals are of course unique in the world and I'm proud of it . We also added the name of the pilot below the cockpit. Well.this did not exist in 1943 as such but .we can do whatever we want with OUR decals , No ? </font></p><p><font face='Arial'>Much was the work of course with the nose art for 'Miss Plainfield' , it took me 2 days , but it did worth the effort </font></p><p><font face='Arial'>The upper surface color used is the acrylic Tamiya XF-51 khaki green and lower surface the light gray Tamiya XF-19 </font></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><font face='Arial'>So everything depends on what color backgrounds you'llneed and you order accordingly. In general both Clear and White decal papers mayhave to be used and that's why I usually order enough quantities of both . </font></p><p><font face='Arial' size='3' color='#0000FF'><b>THE SOFTWARE</b></font></p><p><font face='Arial'>And here we go to the most beautiful part of the art.
