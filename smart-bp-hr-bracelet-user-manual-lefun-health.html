Don’t think about anything.</li><li>Wear your device so that it is snug.</li><li>Your arm should be resting on a flat surface such as a table with the upper arm at heart level.

The best way to check if your device is accurate is to bring it to the doctor’s office. Measure your blood pressure with your fitness watch and compare your doctors’ readings. However, because blood pressure is not an absolute number results may be approximate or close enough.</p><p>However, keep in mind that blood pressure changes during the day depending on the weather, food that you eat, genetics, age, weight, mood, medication, physical activity, stress levels, and alcohol. Blood pressure can be lower at night and will rise before you wake up. It will continue to rise during the day picking up in the afternoon.</p><p>When you measure your blood pressure either at the doctor’s office or with a fitness tracker we are looking for any changes or patterns. You may discover that eating certain foods or doing specific physical activity may increase or decrease your blood pressure.</p><h2><span>My experience with a smart wristband that tracks blood pressure</span></h2><p>Wearing a fitness watch with blood pressure like the Onston fitness tracker for almost a year has transformed my life. <span>Experiencing panic attacks</span> in the past and having a high blood pressure history in my family I always knew the importance of monitoring my blood pressure. It has a quite low rating but it has worked for me plus it is worth the price.</p><p>I compared my wearable fitness’ readings with a Samsung Healthy Living BD-3000S BP monitor that I had since 2003 and that I already showed it to my doctor. Readings also matched my doctor’s. Please note that Samsung’s blood pressure monitor is currently unavailable – Samsung Healthy Living closed in 2009.</p><p>This BP monitor was so old that I had to buy the <span>IVKEY Digital Automatic BP monitor (Find out more about <span>this top-rated blood pressure monitor</span> I bought on Amazon). I recommend it because it has large numbers and a three-color hypertension indicator shown with each reading. It also has an adjustable cuff and 4 AAA batteries included. Also, the IVKEY BP monitor detects irregular heartbeats.</span></p><p>So, let me tell you that I can check my blood pressure continuously or one time to see any trends. My blood pressure is normal but the other day I saw a little bit of increase and got concerned. The log showed that my BP raised by the same time I ate the chocolate cake that I made. What did I learn from this? That blood pressure can be affected by anything we eat or do. However, sometimes we may not even notice or we don’t know the reason!</p><h2><span>What is the best fitness tracker with blood pressure right now?</span></h2><p>These fitness watches with BP monitor can be a tool for those who want to keep track of their heart health and fitness progress.
