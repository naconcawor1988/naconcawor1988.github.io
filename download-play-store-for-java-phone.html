You will also encounter the problem if you are downloading multiple apps simultaneously or a couple of particularly large ones.</p><p>But if you urgently need to download Uber to get a ride, for example, here is what you can do:</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>Google Play &gt; Menu &gt; My apps &amp; games</strong>.</li><li>You will see which applications are in the process of being updated or downloaded.</li><li>Just press the X next to them to cancel the download and proceed with getting the app you urgently need.</li></ol><h2>Check your connection</h2><p>It might sound silly, but this should always be one of the first steps you take.

If it seems to be working but it’s slow, either restart your modem or contact your ISP. If it’s working normally but Google Play is still not downloading your app or game, switch to data temporarily.</p><p>Make sure you’ve enabled downloading on data. Here is how to do that:</p><ol><li>Head to the Play Store and then tap on the menu button in the upper left corner (three lines).</li><li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; App download preference &gt; Over any network</strong>.</li><li>If downloading resumes as normal, your home or office network is to blame. Restart your modem and if all else fails, call your Internet service provider.</li></ol><h2>Check your storage and SD card</h2><p>A common cause for Google Play problems is lack of storage on your phone or SD card. Usually you will receive a notification if your storage is low when attempting a download. However, if you still want to make sure storage is not causing the download to pend, there are a couple of things you can do.</p><ol><li>Check how much free storage you have manually by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Storage</strong>.</li><li>Free up some space by uninstalling unused apps or deleting old photos and videos that you have backed up elsewhere.</li><li>Attempt your download once again.</li></ol><p>If it’s still pending, your SD card might be at fault — it might not be positioned or set up properly. Cancel the download, eject the SD card, then carefully reposition it and reattempt.</p><h2>Restart your device</h2><p>If you aren’t downloading anything and your connection is fine, but your download is still pending, you should try restarting your device. It might be another no-brainer step, but it’s a surprisingly effective one. Just press and hold the power button on your device, then tap Restart.</p><img src='http://alliswall.com/file/3194/1920x1200/16:9/3d-elephant-in-jungle.jpg' alt='Phones' title='Phones'><h2>Download apps through your browser instead</h2><p>You can try circumventing the download pending problem by getting your apps via your mobile or PC browser.
