Although both the operating systems do not provide any easy solution for transferring your data between iOS and Android, there are several other sources that you could take help from. </p><p> Here are some methods that you could easily implement to transfer WhatsApp messages from iPhone to Android. </p><h2> 1. Transfer WhatsApp Messages from iPhone to Android with one click </h2><p> Data transfer between different devices can be much easier than you think. MobileTrans - WhatsApp Transfer provides a one-stop solution to help you to transfer data across mobile devices, as well as computers.

Launch MobileTrans and choose 'WhatsApp Transfer'. </li><li> Connect your devices to the computer. Select “Transfer WhatsApp messages” and let the program detect your devices. </li><li> After that, the following window will appear: </li><li> Click “Start” and then click “yes” to proceed. Keep the devices connected until the process completes. </li></ol><p> If you still do not know how to transfer WhatsApp via MobileTrans, check our video tutorial below: </p><p> Apart from just accomplishing WhatsApp messages backup and restore, MobileTrans also helps you seamlessly transition your contacts, photos, and messages from one phone to another. </p><h2> 2. Transfer WhatsApp Messages from iPhone to Android Using Chat Backup </h2><p> Your WhatsApp chats are automatically backed up and saved daily to your phone's memory. Depending on your settings, you can also periodically backup your WhatsApp chats to Google Drive. </p><ol><li> Open WhatsApp on iPhone and log into your account. </li><li> Navigate to 'Settings' &gt; 'Chats' &gt; 'Chat Backup'. </li><li> Select the 'Back Up Now' button to start backing up current WhatsApp Data. </li><li> Download and install WhatsApp on your Android phone. </li><li> Sign in to your WhatsApp account. WhatsApp will pop up asking you whether to restore data from backup for the first time. </li><li> Choose on 'Restore' if prompted to restore from WhatsApp iCloud and wait until it's done. </li></ol><p> The easiest way to transfer data to a new phone is by using Google Drive. If you want to use a local backup, you'll need to transfer the files to the new phone using a computer, file explorer, or SD Card. </p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li> It requires no additional software like the other methods. </li></ul><h2 id='ios-7-release-date'>Ios 7 Release Date</h2><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li> Although this is an easy method, it sometimes might take you a longer time than expected to restore data. </li><li> WhatsApp backups no longer count towards the Google Drive storage quota. </li><li> WhatsApp backups that haven't been updated in more than one year are automatically removed from Google Drive storage. </li></ul><h2> 3. Transfer WhatsApp Messages from iPhone to Android Using Email Chat </h2><p> Here are the details of how to transfer WhatsApp chat history from iPhone to Android phone with email chat: </p><ol><li> First of all, go to your device’s 'Settings' in WhatsApp from your iPhone, tap on 'Chat Settings', then hit 'Email chat' from the list. </li><li> Select the WhatsApp history that you would like to transfer. A window will pop up saying 'Attaching Media will generate a larger email message'. You just need to click ' Without Media' or ' Attach Media' based on what you need. </li><li> Type in the email address and select 'Send'. </li><li> Log in to your email account on your Android phone, you can view your old WhatsApp chats in an email from your new device. But you can't sync WhatsApp data with your WhatsApp application on Android device. </li></ol><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li> It is a simple process and your chat will land in your inbox. </li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li> One disadvantage of this method is that even though you have sent your WhatsApp data to your android device, you still cannot open it on WhatsApp in your new device; you can only view it. </li><li> It can take some time to upload the chat. If it is very big, sometimes it does not work. </li><li> You must download the chat from the email as the link expires after one month. </li></ul><p> WhatsApp's email chat function is very helpful. By moving WhatsApp chats from iPhone or Android phone to email, it allows users to create a copy of the chats. Compared with WhatsApp's back-up function, email chat is more flexible. </p><p> Users can store just the chosen chats, moreover, they can share the chats with others if they print out their chat history. </p><h2> 4.
