remotely when working from home, we all use the remote control desktop sharing apps. One most popular amongst them is TeamViewer.</p><p>After installing TeamViewer and first connection to the network, the program receives a <strong>unique identification number (ID)</strong>. It allows remote users to perform a remote connection to your computer and vice versa. If you are using a free version of TeamViewer to connect to different computers (commercial purposes), here is a high probability that your remote connections will be limited on the TeamViewer server to a value not exceeding five minutes, after which the connection will be terminated.</p><p>If the TeamViewer servers decide that you are using the utility for commercial purposes to connect to multiple customer computers, a warning window may appear:</p><p>Show All Repair Parts for LF Power Inverter.

Please note that the free version may only be used for personal use.</em></p><p><em>Your session will be terminated after 5 minutes.</em></p><p>The trial version TeamViewer expiration message usually appears after a couple of days of use.</p><p>In this case, you can try to reinstall TeamViewer, but that won’t help you. The only way to unblock the limitation is to reset TeamViewer ID (or purchase a license ).</p><p>You can see your TeamViewer ID on the main screen when running the application.</p><h2>TeamViewer Versions: Trial Expiration Problem</h2><p>There are two TeamViewer versions:</p><ul><li><strong>Free version</strong> (non-commercial use) — designed for home use and connecting to a small number of PCs;</li><li><strong>Paid</strong> (commercial) version — the number of connected PCs and the duration of the sessions are unlimited.</li></ul><p>If you use TeamViewer for personal use only, here’s how to fix the TeamViewer trial expired problem.</p><p>Make sure that you and the users you are connecting using the free version of TeamViewer. If one user uses a free one and the second uses a commercial one, then the commercial version will consider the use of TeamViewer in the commercial purpose.</p><p>If the commercial version of TeamViewer is installed, you need to remove it, clear the registry and folders from the remaining entries and files, and install the free version of TeamViewer.</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>Add or remove</strong> programs, find <strong>TeamViewer</strong> in the list and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>;<br></li><li>After removing the program, press Win+R &gt; %Appdata% 0 &gt; OK. Remove the folder TeamViewer;</li><li>Then delete the directory C:Program FilesTeamViewer;</li><li>Delete the following registry key using the Registry Editor (regedit.exe): ComputerHKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareTeamViewer and ComputerHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWOW6432NodeTeamViewer<br></li><li>Reboot your computer;</li><li>Download and install the TeamViewer free edition (press “Download for free” on TW site);</li></ol><p>If this does not work, move on. There is another more difficult way to extend the TeamViewer usage by resetting TeamViewer ID.</p><p>TeamViewer ID is generated based on several unique attributes of your computer:</p><ul><li>MAC address of the network card;</li><li>VolumeID of disk partition;</li><li>Creation date of folder <strong>Program Files.</strong></li></ul><p>Accordingly, to change TeamViewer ID, you need to change these 3 values.</p><h2>Reset or Change TeamViewer ID in Windows</h2><p>To reset the TeamViewer ID, you need to perform a few steps.</p><p>First of all, kill the TeamViewer.exe process. Then you need to remove the current TeamViewer ID from the registry.</p><ul><li>In <strong>Windows x86</strong>, TeamViewer version [X], open regedit.exe, go to the registry key HKLMSOFTWARETeamViewerVersion[X] and delete DWORD value ClientID;</li><li>In <strong>Windows x64</strong>, delete value ClientID from HKLMSOFTWAREWow6432NodeTeamViewerVersion[X];</li><li>Check if the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareTeamViewer exists and delete it.</li></ul><p>To change the creation date of <strong>Program Files</strong> folder, you can use the <span>NirCMD</span> utility. Download it and run the following command in the elevated Command prompt console:</p><p>To change the MAC address of the network card, you can use special utilities or use the following instructions for manually edit MAC address in the registry.</p><p>To get the current MAC address of your network card, open Command prompt and run the following command:</p><p>We are interested in two parameters:</p><ul><li><strong>Description </strong>(LAN card description) – Intel(R) 82574L Gigabit Network Connection</li><li><strong>Physical Address </strong>(MAC address) – 00-50-56-9E-FC-CB</li></ul><p>Then, open <strong>Registry Editor</strong> and go to the key HKLMSYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlClass{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}.</p><p>Each network component in this branch is indicated by four digits starting from 0000, 0001 and so on. You can find the right key by browsing it and looking for <strong>DriverDesc</strong> option, where the description (name) of your NIC must be specified, for example, Intel(R) 82574L Gigabit Network Connection.</p><p>Once the correct network card is found, add or modify REG_SZ parameter named <strong>NetworkAddress</strong>, which defines MAC (hardware) address of the network card. It is enough to change a single digit in the current MAC address, for example, 0050560EFCCB.</p><p>So, the MAC address of the network card is changed. Now you need to change VolumeID of the system partition. VolumeID (or Volume Serial Number) is a unique identifier of a volume on a hard drive, which is set during formatting.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>. In some cases, TeamViewer is linked to a non-system volume of the disk, or even to the removable media volume, so it is likely that we need to change VolumeID of other partitions.</p><p>To change VolumeID use the console utility <span>VolumeID v2.1</span>. Download and extract archive <strong>VolumeId.zip</strong>.</p><p>Check the current VolumeID by opening a command prompt with Administrator privileges and execute the command:</p><p>Volume Serial Number is <strong>5E37-ECE1</strong>.</p><p>Change current value to new value <strong>5E37-EC11</strong>:</p><p>OnceVolumeId utility updated the volume serial number of your system partition, close the Command Prompt window, and reboot your computer.</p><p>After rebooting, run the app and you will be assigned a new TeamViewer ID.</p><h2>How to Reset TeamViewer ID on Linux?</h2><p>In case you are using TeamViewer on one of the Linux distributions, you can follow the instructions below to reset the TeamViewer ID. The method is tested on Debian 9 and with some modifications you can use it on any Linux distribution.</p><img src='https://nektony.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/delete-trend-micro.png' alt='Teamviewer Helper Tool Mac' title='Teamviewer Helper Tool Mac'><ol><li>Uninstall Teamviewer with <strong>su privileges</strong>;</li><li>Remove the file /var/lib/dbus/machine-id if exist;</li><li>Edit the GUID (you can just replace the last character): mc -e id.txt;</li><li>Change the MAC address of the network card: </li><li>Correct string:<br>pre-up ifconfig eth0 hw ether New_MAC_HERE<br></li><li>Reboot OS;</li><li>Install Teamviewer, it should get a new ClientID.</li></ol><p>In the Linux Mint distro, you can reset TeamViewer ID as follows:</p><ol><li>Delete TeamViewer:sudo dpkg -r teamviewer</li><li>Remove the binding file (if exists): sudo rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id</li><li>Change the NIC’s MAC address;</li><li>Install the TeamViewer package again: sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_13.2.13582_amd64.deb</li><li>If an error with the missing packages occurs, run the command: sudo apt-get install -f</li></ol><p>To change ClientID on a <strong>cloned Linux machine</strong> it’s enough to:</p><ol><li>Stop the TeamViewer daemon;</li><li>Delete TeamViewer settings:</li><li>Remove folder /opt/teamviewer{TW_VERSION_Here)/config;</li><li>Start the TeamViewer daemon.</li></ol><h2>How to Change TeamViewer ID on Mac OS?</h2><p>To change TeamViewer ClientID on the Mac OS, you can use the python script <strong>TeamViewer-id-changer.py</strong> from GitHub. Follow these steps</p><ol><li>Download script from <span>Git Hub</span>;</li><li>Close TeamViewer (make sure the TeamViewer process has completely disappeared from the process list);</li><li>Run the script: sudo ./TeamViewer-id-changer.py;</li><li>Reboot the device.</li></ol><p>This script works correctly for TeamViewer 11, 12, 13 (not tested in TeamViewer 14).</p><p>If reinstalling and resetting TeamViewer ClientID did not help you, and you are sure that you are using TeamViewer for personal use only, you can create a ticket request using the online form to unlock your device (https://www.teamviewer.com/en/support/commercial-use-suspected/). Fill the form, specify a specific TeamViewer ID from your device and send a request.</p><p>After a while (3-5 days), TeamViewer support will answer on your request: your device will be unlocked or your “commercial use” label will remain for your ID. If you use TeamViewer for commercial purposes, buy a license, or try another free remote product to manage your users and customers.</p><p>The post How to Reset TeamViewer ID? appeared first on TheITBros.</p>Skip to end of metadataGo to start of metadata<p>TeamViewer installation for Mac to access remotely a work computer from home.</p><h2>Step-by-step guide</h2><ol><li><strong>Download TeamViewer and install it</strong><ol><li>Download website (also available on Canvas on Texas Undergraduate Studies course for UGS staff): <strong><br></strong>https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/</li><li>Download through 'Download for free' option.<br></li><li>Start installation process, agree to the terms and conditions when prompted. <br><strong><br></strong></li><li><p>Provide User Name and Password, and click on Install.<br></p></li></ol></li><li><strong>Initial Setup</strong><ol><li><span>TeamViewer should automatically start up with an ‘Initial Setup’ pop-up window.
