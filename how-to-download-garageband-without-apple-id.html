GarageBand offers you different project templates that you can choose as per your need. Before creating the music, here is some basic stuff you need to know:</p><h3>Step 1: Opening the Project</h3><p>First of all, you need to open the project area where you will create music. To do that, open the app and <strong>go to File</strong> menu and then select ‘<strong>New</strong>‘. You can also use shortcut key by pressing <strong>⌘+N</strong> to open the new project-</p><p>You will find a couple of options. In songwriter mode, you will get the preset instruments, audio and other stuff you need to <strong>create a new song</strong>. Similarly, in Electronic, you will get the preset trance sounds, bass and drum kicks that will help you in creating EDM and other electronic music. You can choose either of them as per your need but if you want to<strong> start from scratch</strong> without any preset sounds, simply <strong>open Empty Project</strong>.</p><h3>Step 2: Adding Instruments on Empty Project:</h3><p>If you have chosen the <strong>Empty project</strong>, here is what you need to do to start creating music on GarageBand. On the new empty project, you will get a basic Classic Electric Piano. Use your keyboard to play the Piano notes and to record it. You can see the Piano Keyboard on your screen by going to <strong>Windows &gt; Show Musical Typing or press ⌘+K</strong>.</p><p>If you wanted to add more Tracks, simply click on the + icon (see screenshot), select <strong>Empty Project</strong> and add another track.

Creating music on GarageBand is so easy and so much fun, honestly. There is an <strong>inbuilt library of Loops</strong> that you can use in your songs as well. There are loops from different Genres, Moods, Instruments. You can sort the loops as per your need and type of music. You will get to know the Note of the loop as well as the BPM or Tempo of the loop which is also useful for any music creator. You can open the Loop menu from the Top Right corner.
